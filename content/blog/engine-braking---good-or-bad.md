Let us take a small glance about the engine braking before getting into the misconceptions which are related with it.

### What is Engine Braking?

Whenever you roll of the throttle, the butterfly valve closes and prevents the intake air charge to enter into the engine which makes the engine to run out off power. Since the clutch is engaged during this process, the kinetic energy of the rear wheels starts to drive the crankshaft thereby moving the piston. The vacuum produced by the piston with the closed throttle valve produces the necessary retarding force for the vehicle to slowdown. The excess heat produced in the engine is significantly less than that of the heat produced by conventional braking system during hard braking.

The amount of engine braking is dependent on the following parameters.

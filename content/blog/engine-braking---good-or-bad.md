Let us take a small glance about the engine braking before getting into the misconceptions which are related with it.

### What is Engine Braking?

Whenever you roll off the throttle, the butterfly valve closes and prevents the intake air charge to enter into the engine which makes the engine to run out of power. Since the clutch is engaged during this process, the kinetic energy of the rear wheels starts to spin the crankshaft thereby moving the piston. The vacuum produced by the piston with the closed throttle valve produces the necessary retarding force for the vehicle to slow down. The excess heat produced due to engine braking is significantly less than that of the heat produced by conventional braking system during hard braking.

The amount of engine braking is dependent on the following parameters.

#### 1. Engine Cubic Capacity

With the increase in displacement of the engine, the forces responsible for retardation also develops. This makes the larger capacity engines to brake significantly in contrast with small displacement engines.

#### 2. Engine Speed

Letting off the throttle completely at higher engine speed will lead to a production of greater suction force, which is also the reason for the riders to experience a higher braking force at lower gears than in the higher gears at the same vehicle speed.

#### 3. Throttle Opening

A Variable engine braking is possible by controlling the amount butterfly valve opening after letting off the throttle completely. So by increasing the opening angle the effect of engine braking can be limited.

### Good Things First

Engine braking serves to be a very good technique to practice for the following reasons

* By decreasing the usage of traditional braking, the life of brake pads increases significantly. This sounded fictitious to me until I could myself feel the difference.
* Engine braking can be used to a fair amount during bumper to bumper traffic conditions. This allows the rider to have a better command over the braking and acceleration since engine braking is much more engaging for the rider.
* MotoGP riders masters the engine braking techniques and perform it during a corner entry as it allows the rider to concentrate more on cornering and provides the liberty to instantly accelerate to exit the corner.

The only thing you probably have to remember while using engine braking in traffic conditions is that the tail lamp does not light up until the conventional brakes are applied. Riders flash their brakes quickly to alert the traffic behind.

### Element of Danger

1. Whenever you drop on a lower gear its necessary to match the engine RPM to the vehicle speed for a smooth shift. This phenomenon is known as Rev Matching. Engine Braking will be really dangerous when you shift to lower gears without rev matching. This will lead to a serious damage to transmission components.

##### Fix

Blipping the throttle during the downshift allows the engine RPM to increase and to match with the vehicle speed. Since the engine speed is matched, there is no more load on the transmission during the gear drop. This can also be done by Auto-blipper in modern high-performance bikes.

2. When the rider makes multiple aggressive downshifts, there is a possibility of engine RPM surpassing the red-line. In these occasions, the rear wheel will tend to lock and it releases only after disengaging the clutch or shifting to a higher gear. This phenomenon of wheels losing its action is known as Shift-Lock. Engine braking can lead to perilous situations at the time of Shift-Lock. 

##### Fix

Indeed an entry-level sports bike like Ninja 300 is fitted with a slipper clutch as standard. Slipper clutch as the name implies it allows the rear wheel to slip and rotate freely during multiple aggressive downshifts which avoids shift lock and hazardous situations.

### Conclusion

Like many other techniques such as clutch-less up shift and down shift, Engine braking is not going to harm your engine or transmission components when its performed in the way it should.

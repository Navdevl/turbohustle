Let us take a small glance about the engine braking before getting into the misconceptions which are related with it.

### What is Engine Braking?

Whenever you roll of the throttle, the butterfly valve closes and prevents the intake air charge to enter into the engine which makes the engine to run out off power. Since the clutch is engaged during this process, the kinetic energy of the rear wheels starts to drive the crankshaft thereby moving the piston. The vacuum produced by the piston with the closed throttle valve produces the necessary retarding force for the vehicle to slowdown. The excess heat produced due to engine braking is significantly less than that of the heat produced by conventional braking system during hard braking.

The amount of engine braking is dependent on the following parameters.

#### 1. Engine Cubic Capacity

With the increase in displacement of the engine, the forces responsible for retardation also increases. This makes the larger capacity engines to brake significantly in comparison with small displacement engines.

#### 2. Engine Speed

Letting off the throttle completely at higher engine speed will lead to a production of greater suction force, which is also the reason for the riders to experience a higher braking force at lower gears than in the higher gears at the same vehicle speed.

#### 3. Throttle Opening

A Variable engine braking is possible by controlling the amount butterfly valve opening after letting off the throttle completely. So by increasing the opening angle the effect of engine braking can be decreased.

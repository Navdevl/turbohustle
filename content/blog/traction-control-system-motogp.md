description = "A MotoGP bike losing its traction moving sideways with excessive wheel spin can be a great site for the spectators, but definitely not for the rider who is trying to exploit every split second. A muscular engine pumping out 250 horses is quite ample for a wheel to lose its traction, So modern day electronics are the ones to rely on for rider's safety."

Traction can be defined as the friction between the driven wheel and the asphalt upon which its driven. A MotoGP bike pumping 250 horses needs necessary traction to propel the vehicle. When the wheels are powered abundantly in the condition of less traction can lead to wheel spin.

### Factors Influencing Traction

When the rear wheel loses traction and spins excessively, the traction control system intrudes and alters the power delivery to the rear wheel so that the wheel spin is controlled. Before getting everything in detail, it's important to know the science behind traction.

#### 1. Coefficient of Friction

The coefficient of friction between the pavement and the rubber determines the gluey nature of the tires. The coefficient of friction between the tire and the tarmac can be improved by introducing soft tire compounds. Soft tire compounds can serve with exceptional traction but have a tendency to rip off easily when compared with tougher compounds.

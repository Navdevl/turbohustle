description = "A MotoGP bike losing its traction moving sideways with excessive wheel spin can be a great site for the spectators, but definitely not for the rider who is trying to exploit every split second. A muscular engine pumping out 250 horses is quite ample for a wheel to lose its traction, So modern day electronics are the ones to rely on for rider's safety."

Traction can be defined as the friction between the driven wheel and the asphalt upon which it's driven. A MotoGP bike pumping 250 horses needs significant traction to propel the vehicle. When the wheels are powered abundantly in the condition of less traction can lead to wheel spin.

### Factors Influencing Traction

When the rear wheel loses traction and spins excessively, the traction control system intrudes and alters the power delivery to the rear wheel so that the wheel spin is controlled. Before getting everything in detail, it's important to know the science behind traction.

#### 1. Coefficient of Friction

The coefficient of friction between the pavement and the rubber determines the gluey nature of the tires. The coefficient of friction between the tire and the tarmac can be enhanced by introducing soft tire compounds. Soft tire compounds can serve with exceptional traction but ought to rip off easily when compared with tires made of tougher compounds.

#### 2. Normal Force

The significance of frictional force is directly proportional to the force which pushes the two surfaces together. In this case of motorcycle riding, the weight of the bike and the rider acts as the normal force. As long as the bike remain straight, the entire weight forces the tires to stay on the ground which in turn enhances the amount of traction. Things grow complicated only when the rider leans over a corner. Since the resultant force which enforces the bike to the pavement is a product of the cumulative weight and the cosine of the lean angle. So the traction reduces as the lean angle increases. But if the normal force exceeds a target value then the coefficient of friction decreases with the increase in normal force.

### MotoGP Electronics

The whole point of traction control is to enhance rider's safety and its not much of a performance intensification. The traction control system developed by **Magneti Marelli** modifies the power delivery in a cautious manner without indulging the stability of the bike. Let's talk some tech stuff

#### Scenario Overview

This collection of information is from the rider in Turn 5 of Circuito de Jerez which is also known as Sito Pons Corner. From **Number 1**, the rider firmly opens up the throttle and pings completely as he exits the corner. The green curve shows that the rider provides and alters the throttle opening in an to and fro manner as per the wheel spin experienced by the rider.

The red curve indicates the speed of the engine in RPM. From **Number 7**, the engine speed increases as the rider open up the throttle. As the rider shifts on the higher gears, there is a dip in engine speed momentarily during gear shifts. This is due to the quick shifting strategy made to reduce the load on the transmission during gear shifts.

#### Factors to be Considered

The traction control system assesses the wheel spin by considering the vehicle speed and the speed with which the rear wheel rotates. **Number 2** shows the wheel spin target, which can vary based on the rider characteristics. Since the wheel spin during full lean is threatening, the target wheel spin is set to a very low value about 0 to 2 percent. As the rider straightens up after the full lean, the target wheel spin is relaxed progressively.

Since the rider cracks the throttle completely during the corner exit, the bike enters the zone of excessive wheel spin. From **Number 3**, it's evident that the wheel spin strikes above targeted value. As the wheel spin jumps out of the target, the traction control system intrudes the power delivery and forces the wheel spin to be on target. **Number 4** is the lean angle which is fed from the inertial measurement unit. The rider and the wheel spin has a very close relationship with the lean angle made.

#### Power Reduction Strategies

The fastest way of torque reduction is through retardation of ignition angles and the quietest way is probably altering the air delivery through the reduction in throttle angle. Since retardation in ignition angles produces jerks which can lead to instability especially during maximum lean, the most preferable strategy of power reduction is the alteration of throttle angles.

**Number 5** shows that the torque demanded by the rider has been intruded by the traction control system as it senses the loss of traction through extreme wheel spin. The traction control system reduces the torque produced to bring down the wheel spin to the target value. As soon as the target is within limits, the traction control system liberates the power reduction which again makes the wheel spin to go beyond the targeted value so on.

**Number 6** shows the opening angles of the two butterfly valves. One butterfly valve is made to operate as per the rider inputs. Its evident that the other butterfly valve is controlled by the traction control system since the two lines follow a similar kind of pattern to reduce torque delivered. Changes to the throttle angle are made very progressively since sudden changes can cause the stability of the bike.

### Conclusion

It's so apparent that the electronics from **Magneti Marelli** has made a MotoGP rocket-ship a safer one to ride on.

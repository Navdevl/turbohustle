description = "A MotoGP bike losing its traction moving sideways with excessive wheel spin can be a great site for the spectators, but definitely not for the rider who is trying to exploit every split second. A muscular engine pumping 250 horses is quite ample for a wheel to lose its traction, So modern day electronics are the ones to rely on for rider's safety."

# INTRODUCTION

Engines losses its power in the matter of certain years and you feel like it's not the same engine that it used to be. All you need to do is to rebuild your engine to regain its lost power. But engine rebuilding doesn't seem to be an easy-to-do job it needs a high level of accuracy and knowledge of engines. Failing in this may result in expensive lessons. A single wrong move in setting the proper timing is enough to make your engine into a scrap. So here are some guidelines which will help you in engine rebuilding.

## 1. ORGANIZING WORKPLACE![](/img/2018/04/13 - 6.jpg)

The first step towards a proper rebuild is to plan each and every move and should be able to organize the tools necessary for it. Make sure the engine is hoisted with the necessary lifting device in proper position. Getting the necessary tools for the operation in one place will be very helpful in focusing on the engine when working in it. Once a component is removed labeling them properly is necessary since it will be very helpful during the installation process. Even taking some photographs at every stage of removing the engine will come handy.

## 2. REMOVE OTHER ACCESSORIES![](/img/2018/04/FH12APR_REPALT_01-2.jpg)

Now its time to remove those electrical connectors and other accessories out of your engine. Make sure the electric connectors are labeled in a way it can make fixing it easier. Other external components such as starter, alternator etc must safely disconnect from the engine. Disconnect intake air supply and pressurized fuel lines. Spark plugs and injectors can be removed and label them with respect to cylinder numbers. Changing injectors between the cylinders need adaptation in engine control modules. Failing to do so will reduce the accuracy of fuel delivery.

## 3. UNFASTEN CYLINDER HEAD![](/img/2018/04/1108dp_13 gateway_to_power gasket_removal.jpg)

After removing the additional engine components, its time to enter the core of the engine. Remove the timing gear from the crankshaft drive gear and mark the necessary so its easier to set the engine timing. After the camshafts are removed move on with the valves. With the help of a valve compressing device try to remove the retaining lock thereby removing the cylinder head valves. Verify the flatness of valves and ensure that the dimensions are not much deviated. The camshafts are also verified for the necessary lift they produce with measuring cam lobes.

## 4. STRIP THE CRANKCASE![](/img/2018/04/741dfbeb52925043c9edc68bbf8dc209--fox-ford-mustangs.jpg)

After the removal of the cylinder heads, removing damper pulley and the connecting rod bolts from the crankshaft will be an ideal move. After removing the connecting rod bolts remove the piston with the connecting rod from the top of the crankcase. Remove the bearings of the crankshaft and remove the crankshaft from the crankcase. If the engine is with a counter shaft remove it from the crankcase.

## 5. MACHINING AND MEASUREMENTS![](/img/2018/04/1.8tenginebearings400500hp.jpg)

Mechanical measurements plays a vital role in rebuilding any of the engine since engine is all about precision and accuracy. Check the crankshaft and the connecting rod for the diameter and necessary machining must be done so that necessary bearing can also be added to it. The cylinder bore should be measured for the roundness so the measuring process is carried out in both lateral direction and transverse direction. After the measurements are finished the desired dimensions are brought up by honing process.

## 6. REPLACE PISTON AND RINGS![](/img/2018/04/DSC_06891-1080x723.jpg)

Piston and piston rings can be replaced with the required dimensions and in needed crown shape. Forged pistons and set the piston rings in proper order and necessary offset. Connect the piston to the connecting rods with the piston pin and insert them into the crankcase with the aid of ring compressors.

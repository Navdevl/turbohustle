Engines losses its power in the matter of certain years and you feel like it's not the same engine that it used to be. All you need to do is to rebuild your engine to regain its lost power. But engine rebuilding doesn't seem to be an easy-to-do job it needs a high level of accuracy and knowledge of engines. Failing in this may result in expensive lessons. A single wrong move in setting the proper timing is enough to make your engine into a scrap. So here are some guidelines which will help you in engine rebuilding.

## 1. ORGANIZING WORKPLACE

The first step towards a proper rebuild is to plan each and every move and should be able to organize the tools necessary for it. Make sure the engine is hoisted with the necessary lifting device in proper position. Getting the necessary tools for the operation in one place will be very helpful in focusing on the engine when working in it. Once a component is removed labeling them properly is necessary since it will be very helpful during the installation process. Even taking some photographs at every stage of removing the engine will come handy.

## 2. REMOVE OTHER ACCESSORIES

Now its time to remove those electrical connectors and other accessories out of your engine. Make sure the electric connectors are labeled in a way it can make fixing it easier. Other external components such as starter, alternator etc must safely disconnect from the engine. Disconnect intake air supply and pressurized fuel lines. Spark plugs and injectors can be removed and label them with respect to cylinder numbers. Changing injectors between the cylinders need adaptation in engine control modules. Failing to do so will reduce the accuracy of fuel delivery.

## 3. UNFASTEN CYLINDER HEAD

After removing the additional engine components, its time to enter the core of the engine. Remove the timing gear from the crankshaft drive gear and mark the necessary things so its easier to set the engine timing. After the camshafts are removed move on with the valves. With the help of a valve compressing device try to remove the retaining lock thereby removing the cylinder head valves. Verify the flatness of valves and ensure that the dimensions are not much deviated. The camshafts are also verified for the necessary lift they produce with measuring cam lobes.

## 4. STRIP THE CRANKCASE

After the removal of the cylinder heads, removing damper pulley and the connecting rod bolts from the crankshaft will be an ideal move. After removing the connecting rod bolts remove the piston with the connecting rod from the top of the crankcase. Remove the bearings of the crankshaft and remove the crankshaft from the crankcase. If the engine is with a countershaft remove it from the crankcase.

## 5. MACHINING AND MEASUREMENTS

Mechanical measurements play a vital role in rebuilding engine since engine seems to be all about precision and accuracy. Check the crankshaft and the connecting rod for the diameter and necessary machining must be done so that necessary bearing can also be added to it. The cylinder bore should be measured for the roundness so the measuring process is carried out in both lateral direction and transverse direction. After the measurements are finished the desired dimensions are brought up by honing process.

## 6. REPLACE PISTON AND RINGS

Piston and piston rings can be replaced with the required dimensions and in needed crown shape. Forged pistons and set the piston rings in proper order and necessary offset. Connect the piston to the connecting rods with the piston pin and insert them into the crankcase with the aid of ring compressors. Before installing the pistons clean the crankcase and lubricate them with engine oil.

## 7. REPLACE GASKETS

Replace the old gaskets with the new ones and make sure it sits on the clean surface. If there are some residual gaskets present remove it before installing with a new one. Spending valuable money on gaskets is really necessary since gasket leaks can cause many major problems. Worn out cylinder head gaskets may lead to major problems like mixing of coolant and engine oil. And will also lead to compression loss which decreases the power output of the engine.

## 8. ENGINE TIMING

Setting proper engine timing is a significant process in any of engine rebuilding process. There are two types of timing in an engine they are Ignition timing and Cam timing with respect to crankshaft positions. Ignition timing must be adjusted with the distributor with the help of proper firing order. Using a timing light its possible to find when the spark occurs and correct it to the desired timing using crankshaft angle position. In most of the cases, the engine's cam timing is set at the ignition TDC of the first cylinder. The nomenclature may vary for different car manufacturers.

## 9. INSTALL IN REVERSE ORDER

After setting the proper engine timing your engine is all set to go. Now its time to install all other engine components in the exact reverse order as it was. Replace all the gaskets with the new ones and set all the needed electrical components and fix the engine and install it in the car.

## CONCLUSION

There is no feeling in the world better than seeing your engine run after cranking it for the first time. Correct the air-fuel ratios with the help of lambda sensor. And that is it Your car is all set to go...

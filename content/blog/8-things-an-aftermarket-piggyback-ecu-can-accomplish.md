# Introduction 

Leaving behind some of the deceivers who promises to add +35 or so HP, We will be discussing on the true science behind chip tuning. So what it actually does? A Piggyback ECU gathers data about the engine, vehicle and ambient conditions from the stock ECU through various sensors and alters the values sent to the actuators. A key benefit in exploiting a Piggyback ECU is that it can be easily switched to the stock settings if necessary. There are some performance chips which hacks the information from sensors, alters it and sends it to the ECU for Improving performance. 

So here are some beneficial features that an handy Piggyback can provide you with

## 1. Acceleration Enrichment

The Volumetric efficiency mapping holds good for static and steady state conditions. When there is a tip-in condition i.e During a sudden acceleration, The rider twists the throttle, the throttle valve opens immediately causing more air to enter into the manifolds crumbling away the fuel film in port injection engines. This makes the engine to run lean momentarily which causes a loss in torque. A rider opening the throttle needs more torque so this loss in torque cannot be allowed. So some Enrichment mappings are done by considering the TPS (Throttle position) rate and MAP ( Manifold Absolute Pressure) rate and adds excess fuel to compensate the lean AFR and so improving drivability. This process of adding additional fuel in the perfect instance where it is most needed is known as acceleration enrichment. This allows the power to be delivered in a linear way.


## 2. Injector Extender

By just making the AFR richer it is possible to make more power so the simplest way to add more fuel is to extend the injector’s duty cycle. Basically the fuel injectors are always connected with the positive terminal and the stock ECU operates it by providing the ground signal for the necessary duration known as duty cycle. These kind of injector extender chips extends the duty cycle by providing the ground signal even after the stock ECU disconnects , so there is no chance of the stock ECU knowing about this hack. This type of chip tuning does not provides you any warning lamp in the dash but having too large duty cycle may lead to failure of Injectors itself.


## 3. Increasing Rail Pressure
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1523682722207_Fuel-Pressure-Regulator.jpg)


Since the amount of fuel injected will increase with the increase in fuel pressure its a good to have a higher rail pressure for more fuel delivery without changing the Injector’s duty cycle. And How is it done? A chip is connected to the rail pressure sensor in order to provide a lesser value of actual pressure. Consider if the rail pressure is around 5 Bar and the introduction of chip may provide a value of 4.5 Bar to the Engine control unit. So the ECU actuates the fuel pump to attain the prescribed 5 Bar pressure. In reality you are running your fuel with a pressure above 5.5 Bar and so injecting more fuel. This method of adding more fuel is less used since highly intelligent computers will assume that there is a pressure leak in the fuel system and may show errors in dash and there is a possibility of even engine running in Limp Home mode.


## 4. Boost Pressure Control
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1523684717393_modp-1301-06-oturbosmart-e-boost2boost-controller.jpg)


A boost control is the device used to control the boost levels in intake manifold of an Turbocharged engine. This can be executed by a mechanical spring system But why is there a need for a Electronic Control System ? Since the control is only dependent on the pressure in the Intake manifold it fails in some places where there is a abrupt movement of throttle pedal which causes the turbo to be less responsive. So an Electronic controller which controls boost with the change in RPM and Throttle pedal movement is necessary to have a good boost control. A aftermarket piggyback ECU can provide the necessary boost control by actuating the waste gate controller with its data from different sensors.


## 5. Idle Speed control
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1523688357576_2011-subaru-impreza-wrx-sti-instrument-cluster-photo-358898-s-1280x782.jpg)


Its true that the engine will perform at its best when the ignition timing is set at MBT. But in idle speed its necessary to have a constant RPM in spite of small load changes, So in order to have a torque reserve, Ignition timing is retarded from MBT at the idle RPM range so any increase in vehicle load can be curbed with the advancing of ignition timing. Since changing ignition timing instantaneously affects the torque produced it serves to be the better way in responding to the load changes. Whereas changing the throttle valve and AFR takes some considerable time to respond. The torque reserve provided by ignition timing serves good but if the load changes are beyond the scope of Ignition timing then the actuation of throttle valve comes into act.


## 6. Launch Control
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1523987599904_F56_JCW_2128.jpg)


A impeccable start is key to the success in any racing events. Being too hard in the start may lead to higher stress level in your drive train which may lead to wheel spin and penalize those precious seconds of your launch. And in Turbo Charged engines creating the necessary boost before the launch may produce wonders by leading  into the first corner. Hence having a Launch control Interface (also known as 2 Step Rev Limiter) will help you to maintain the Engine at a particular RPM even if you floor the gas pedal. It will maintain the stipulated Engine RPM by producing some misfire in the Engine, Since there is no restriction to flow it will help you in spooling up the Turbo’s. This first limiting RPM may be dependent on road conditions, tires used, torque produced..etc so it may vary for different scenarios. This will ensure that the entire power produced is exploited on the tarmac where it has to be.


## 7. Flat Foot Shifting
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1523992317356_008.JPG)


Flat foot shifting enables to floor the gas pedal even at the time of gear shifts which allows to maintain the boost in the Turbo and have a greater power welcoming the next gear without any time lag. The Flat foot shifting enables smooth gear shifts by retarding the ignition timing and so reducing the torque for the small interval of time. As it does not drop down the boost provided by the turbo it serves to be a valuable upgrade for manual shifting cars. Using a flat foot shifting system can serve you better than an Anti Lag system which produces Turbo failures.

## 1. No Too Rich or Too Lean : Balance is the key when it comes to AFR 

Most stock manufacturer tune the engine for having a good gas mileage and to overcome the strict emission norms by slaughtering the valuable power output. Balance is the key when it comes to AFR (Air Fuel Ratio). Leaning out the mixture too much will lead to cause of additional cylinder peak temperature and cause damage to the engines whereas too rich will lead to un-burned fuel which is the worst thing you can do to your engine. If AFR crossing the extreme limits, may will lead to no combustion at all.

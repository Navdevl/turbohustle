# Introduction 
Bored of your stock performance? Here are some hacks to revitalize your ride performance and to enhance the drivability. 

When it comes to additional torque, people are ready to spend thousands of bucks to an EFI tuner and other kind of performance garages. But with the lack of knowledge on these actual stuffs may lead to ruin your car or end up with some expensive lessons. So it is important to know what is actually done in a performance garage to proliferate those additional horses. And this post is all about the major performance mods and will help you in providing a better understanding of stuffs. 

Here are the 10 Tips to skyrocket your car’s performance


## 1. No Too Rich or Too Lean : Balance is the key when it comes to AFR

Most stock manufacturer tune the engine for having a good gas mileage and to overcome the strict emission norms by slaughtering the valuable power output. Balance is the key when it comes to AFR (Air Fuel Ratio). Leaning out the mixture too much will lead to cause of additional cylinder peak temperature and cause damage to the engines whereas too rich will lead to un-burned fuel which is the worst thing you can do to your engine. If AFR crossing the extreme limits, may will lead to no combustion at all. So tuning your Engine’s AFR in between RBT ( Richest Mixture for Best Torque) and LBT (Leanest Mixture for Best Torque) will provide good performance and a slightly leaner ratio around 15.6:1 can provide you with a best gas mileage.


## 2. Fuel Injectors which matches the needs

If you are increasing the airflow in order to increase the performance, spending some valuable time on choosing a injector will be critical. Make sure the injector and the fuel lines used in the engines doesn't run out of capacity. Having a high performance fuel pump for increasing the pressure in the fuel lines are really helpful to decrease the duty cycle of the Injectors by increasing the flow rate of injectors which will release the stress of injectors when operating for higher fuel requirements. Vehicles fitted with after market Turbo’s has a greater possibility of running out the capacity of the fuel system. So it is important to select the optimum fuel injection system with some safety margin.


## 3. Setting Ignition Timing close to MBT

After having a air and fuel setup which is able to pump out more power from your engine its time to concentrate on the time at which the combustion takes place. Every engine will produce a maximum torque at a particular timing this point of crank angle (usually Before TDC and may vary for different load and speed) at which most torque is extracted from the engine is known as the MBT (Maximum Brake Torque). Since most of the car manufacturers set the ignition timing to MBT at lower RPM’s and Part load it is not necessary to change that. The modification is only at higher RPM’s and Higher Load since these are the points were knock tends to occur to your engine if you are setting the timing MBT. Since OEM manufacturers have a large safety of margin for knock we lose the actual power developed. Since we are burning a much richer AFR at higher loads it can be compensated for some more ignition advance and can reduce the safety margin. But Knock should be avoided in a engine at any cost.


## 4. Increase octane rating and the results are astonishing

Logically speaking Increasing octane numbers cannot increases engine torque. Octane rating of the fuel determines how good the fuel can withstand the phenomenon of knocking. To make it simple the fuel with 92 octane rating can be aggressively  all the way near MBT than the fuel with 87 octane rating. Using a racing fuel which has a octane rating of 100 instantly adds up to +20 HP or even more upon the engine. But with addition of horses comes the addition of cost. Racing fuel generally is more than 300% the cost of premium gasoline.

# Introduction 
Bored of your stock performance? Here are some hacks to revitalize your ride performance and to enhance the drivability. 

When it comes to additional torque, people are ready to spend thousands of bucks to an EFI tuner and other kind of performance garages. But with the lack of knowledge on these actual stuffs may lead to ruin your car or end up with some expensive lessons. So it is important to know what is actually done in a performance garage to proliferate those additional horses. And this post is all about the major performance mods and will help you in providing a better understanding of stuffs. 

Here are the 10 Tips to skyrocket your car’s performance


## 1. No Too Rich or Too Lean : Balance is the key when it comes to AFR 
{{< img-post path="date" file="not-too-rich-or-too-lean.jpg" alt="No Too Rich or Too Lean" >}}

Most stock manufacturer tune the engine for having a good gas mileage and to overcome the strict emission norms by slaughtering the valuable power output. Balance is the key when it comes to AFR (Air Fuel Ratio). Leaning out the mixture too much will lead to cause of additional cylinder peak temperature and cause damage to the engines whereas too rich will lead to un-burned fuel which is the worst thing you can do to your engine. If AFR crossing the extreme limits, will lead to no combustion at all. So tuning your Engine’s AFR in between RBT ( Richest Mixture for Best Torque) and LBT (Leanest Mixture for Best Torque) will provide good performance and a slightly leaner ratio around 15.6:1 can provide you with a best gas mileage.


## 2. Fuel Injectors which matches the needs

If you are increasing the airflow in order to increase the performance, spending some valuable time on choosing a injector will be critical. Make sure the injector and the fuel lines used in the engines doesn't run out of capacity. Having a high performance fuel pump for increasing the pressure in the fuel lines are really helpful to decrease the duty cycle of the Injectors by increasing the flow rate of injectors which will release the stress of injectors when operating for higher fuel requirements. Vehicles fitted with after market Turbo’s has a greater possibility of running out the capacity of the fuel system. So it is important to select the optimum fuel injection system with some safety margin.


## 3. Setting Ignition Timing close to MBT
{{< img-post path="date" file="setting-ignition-timing-close-to-mbt.jpg" alt="Setting Ignition Timing close to MBT" >}}

After having a air and fuel setup which is able to pump out more power from your engine its time to concentrate on the time at which the combustion takes place. Every engine will produce a maximum torque at a particular timing this point of crank angle (usually Before TDC and may vary for different load and speed) at which most torque is extracted from the engine is known as the MBT (Maximum Brake Torque). Since most of the car manufacturers set the ignition timing to MBT at lower RPM’s and Part load it is not necessary to change that. The modification is only at higher RPM’s and Higher Load since these are the points were knock tends to occur to your engine if you are setting the timing MBT. Since OEM manufacturers have a large safety of margin for knock we lose the actual power developed. Since we are burning a much richer AFR at higher loads it can be compensated for some more ignition advance and can reduce the safety margin. But Knock should be avoided in a engine at any cost.


## 4. Increase octane rating and the results are astonishing
{{< img-post path="date" file="increase-octane-rating-and-the-results-are-astonishing.jpg" alt="Increase octane rating and the results are astonishing" >}}

Logically speaking Increasing octane numbers cannot increases engine torque. Octane rating of the fuel determines how good the fuel can withstand the phenomenon of knocking. To make it simple the fuel with 92 octane rating can be aggressively mapped all the way near MBT than the fuel with 87 octane rating. Using a racing fuel which has a octane rating of 100 instantly adds up to +20 HP or even more upon the engine. But with addition of horses comes the addition of cost. Racing fuel generally is more than 300% the cost of premium gasoline.



## 5. Calm Down your boost with an Intercooler

Making Boost pressure is fine but without producing a cooling effect will result in Knocking or detonation in the engines at higher loads. This will make your ignition timing to get retarded in order to avoid knock and slaughtering the power producing capacity of the engine. So high capacity turbo’s should be accompanied with high performance intercooler. Both Water-to-Air and Air-to-Air Intercoolers has their own discrete Pros and Cons. So its up to the individual to select the right one


## 6. Empower your Engine to Breathe Well
{{< img-post path="date" file="empower-your-engine-to-breathe-well.jpg" alt="Empower your Engine to Breathe Well" >}}

A clogged air filter will restrict your engine from getting the fresh air from the atmosphere and will result in reduced volumetric efficiency therefore limiting the power developed by the the engine. So having a proper clean and less restrictive air intake will lead to a good and efficient system and will also make your engine free from dust particles.


## 7. Nitrous - The most Devastating performance Mods in existence
{{< img-post path="date" file="nitrous.jpg" alt="Nitrous" >}}


Nitrous oxide does not break down into nitrogen and oxygen until it reaches 572 degrees Fahrenheit. This means that it absorbs a tremendous amount of heat from the incoming air charge, reducing inlet air temperature by 60-75 degrees, further increasing power. So having a intake system with nitrous will need the necessary amount of additional fuel. So the usage of Wet Nitrous systems serves better since the additional fuel is also provided with the nitrous itself instead of having a Dry Nitrous system and changing the fuel metering.


## 8. A Unconstrained Exhaust System

If the exhaust system provides a unconstrained path for the exhaust gases to the atmosphere it will make the engine breathe efficiently. And the major advantage of having a high performance aftermarket exhaust is the weight reduction as compared to the stock ones. The stock ones is heavy due to the material used and to manage the overall cost of the vehicle.


## 9. The cheapest way of Improving Drivability

A sticky tires may cause wonders while cornering and provides the driver with a great control over the vehicle at different driving conditions. Investing money on good tires will actually help you in carrying the power output produced by your engine on to the road or tarmac where it as to be necessary. It is necessary to realize sole connection between a rider and the unforgiving asphalt is a thin, pliable hoop of rubber encircling the wheel. Its important to have a exhaust piping which does not sacrifice the velocity for the sake of capacity and vice versa. Lowering the pipe diameter will increase the Exhaust velocity and Increasing the pipe diameter will increase the exhaust flow capacity. Balance is the key here.


## 10. Brake it without Breaking

Having a better braking system strengthens the guts to resolute and accelerate your asphalt to its ultimate limit as you have something secured to rely on. High Performance Braking rotors has a better cooling effect and is capable of reducing the braking distance. Every time when a corner is ahead of you, a good braking system can move your braking marker more further improving lap times. This will actually help you to take much more speed into the corners.

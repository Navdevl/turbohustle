description = "The octane rating of the gasoline increases in response to the injection of methanol in it. And injecting water particles into the intake air charge reduces its temperature. So water and methanol injection prove to be the most cost-effective way to pump out more horses from the engine without spending additional $$$ on race fuels."

Racing fuels tend to be costlier than premium gasoline. The prime necessity of using a racing fuel is due to its higher octane rating which makes the engine less likely to knock which enables the calibrator to advance to the ignition timing in close proximity with MBT for more torque. Injecting water particles in the intake charge stream converts them into water vapor, thus providing a cooling effect to the intake charge  A general rule of thumb is that an engine will output one percent more horsepower for every 10 degrees intake temperature is decreased.

### History

The water methanol injection dates back to the early 1940's where it was used in the fighter aircraft of World War II . The injection of water methanol pumped out more power from the engine and thus enabling a good take off. Due to the improvements in octane rating of the gasoline in the later period the practice of water methanol injection took a halt for a while. But with the ability to improve octane rating of the pump gas, this technique came into picture again as being a best alternative to race fuels.

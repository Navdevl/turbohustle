description = "Port fuel injection marked a phenomenal origination in gasoline engines by providing great accuracy in the quantity of fuel injected which made manufacturers to meet the emission norms. As the emission norms got very harsh, manufacturers are made to come up with new technologies such as direct injection in the gasoline engines. Direct injection gasoline engines are capable of injecting the precise amount of fuel in the combustion chamber making the engine to run at target air-fuel ratio. And by providing different operating modes direct injection engines came up with great power figures without compromising fuel economy."

In spite of the same engine cycle and the operation, there is a fair amount of differences in both of these injection process. Each having its own advantages and disadvantages when they come into operation.

### Injection Time

In Direct injection gasoline engine, the injection timing differs for different operating modes namely stratified and homogeneous modes. In stratified injection mode, the injection process takes place at the end of the compression stroke and operates in a very lean air-fuel ratio. This ultra-lean mode provides great fuel economy. And the NOx produced is absorbed by the NOx collector. In the Homogeneous mode of fuel injection, the injection takes place in the intake stroke of engine cycle where the air and fuel mix thoroughly and is compressed and ignited. When the engine needs power and to regenerate the exhaust components, it operates in a homogeneous mode.

In Port injection gasoline engine, the injector is placed before and directed towards the intake valves. The injection takes place during the intake stroke. There are two types of injection strategies namely Batch-wise injection and Sequential injection. Most of the OEM uses sequential injection method since it provides a better control over the fuel injection process. Batch-wise injection is well known for its simplicity as a batch of fuel injectors operate at the same time twice in one engine cycle.

### Fuel Rail Pressure

In port fuel injection a constant pressure is built up and is maintained by the fuel pump and the pressure regulator valve. The rail pressure depends on the boost pressure produced and as per the injector flow rate. The fuel rail pressure of a port injection gasoline injection with forced induction will range from 4 Bar to 6 Bar.

In Direct injection gasoline engines, the pressure of the fuel rail is changed as per the operating conditions by controlling the quantity control valve and pressure regulator valve in the fuel rail. The fuel is first compressed by the low-pressure pump to about 6 Bar and enters the high-pressure pump for further compression to reach the injection pressure. The high-pressure pump compresses the fuel to about 350 Bar and is not always constant and changes as per operating conditions and flow rate of the fuel.

### Injector Pulse Width

Injector pulse width is the amount of time the injector is actuated to hold open and is also dependent on the fuel requirements, the fuel pressure in the rail, and the fuel injectorâ€™s flow rate. For example, consider engine is running at 4000 RPM so the engine cycle is about 30 milliseconds and assume based metered air the injector pulse width is 5 ms which is almost 17% Injector duty cycle.

In port injection gasoline engines the injector pulse width can go even up to the completion of two strokes in a four-stroke cycle whereas indirect injection engines due to the higher fuel pressure and injector flow rate the injector pulse width ranges between 0.4 to 5 microseconds.

### Fuel System

The port injection engines operate at a much lesser fuel pressure to a low-pressure fuel pump feeding the fuel into the rail with about 40 to 60 psi comprises the fuel system. The fuel rail is either made of plastic or stainless steel hence reducing the cost of the fuel systems of port injection engines.

Since direct injection engines operate at approx 350 bar, the fuel feed from the low-pressure pump is again compressed by the high-pressure pump. This high-pressure pump is driven by the lobes in the camshaft. Since higher pressure is used a much higher quality of fuel lines must be used which makes the direct injection fuel system a much expensive one.

### Types of Injector drivers

**Saturated or High Impedance Driver**

Most of the factory built cars with port fuel injection comes with the saturated type driver which supplies 12 V to the injectors to open as the ECU commands to do it. This is an inexpensive yet a reliable injector driver since it operates at 12 V. Due to its high impedance around 12 to 16 ohm the driver circuit carries a lower current value about 1.5 A. Since it has a lower amperage value the circuit remains cool and is much more reliable. The response time of the fuel injector is considerably higher when compared to the latter. Since it produces a small magnetic field there is a delay in both the opening and closing of the fuel injector. Hence opening and closing delays are to be considered while calculating injector pulse width.

**Peak and Hold or Low Impedance Driver**

Direct injection engines use Peak and Hold injector drive with a very low resistance (2 -5 ohm) which produces around 60 to 70 V with the help of capacitors. As soon as the ECU commands injection the circuit collapses and a 70 V is provided between the injectors to open the needle quickly. In this stage of injection the peak current ranges around 12 A and its the peak stage of injector actuation. After this, the current flow is reduced to 3 to 5 A by reducing the voltage difference to hold the injector for the predetermined pulse width. Since there is no delay in the opening of the fuel injector, the injection feels a much more responsive. Due to its higher amperage value, the driver remains very hot during operation

Most of the OEM port injected engines uses saturated drivers and some of the engines used for motorsports are modified with peak and hold for gaining response whereas the direct injection engines use peak and hold drivers.

### Carbon Deposit

The vaporized oil from the engine is collected by the Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve and feed to the intake stream. This Deposits oil particle on the intake valves causing the carbon deposits. In port injection engines since the fuel is injected over the intake valves, it produces a cleaning effect on valves. Hence the carbon deposits on the port injection engine valves seem to be in a negligible amount.

Indirect injection engines there is no cleansing effect on the intake valves which leads to excessive carbon deposits on the valves over a period of time. Valve cleaning is an expensive process since it comprises engine overhauling. So in order to avoid such carbon deposits, the vaporized oil is collected by running them through the oil separator and then into the intake stream. The centrifuge can also be used to separate oil from the charge air mixture.

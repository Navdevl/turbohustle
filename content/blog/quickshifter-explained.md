description = "Quick shifters are handy when it comes to riding a bike on a track since it makes up-shifts lightening quick. But this is not the only reason you will need a quick shifter, the reason is it's absolutely great to put them in action. Keeping the throttle completely twisted and shifting through the gears without dipping the throttle back is one of the most insane feeling ever."

Clutch-less gear shifting is done by many riders manually by dipping the throttle precisely during the up-shifts. It requires a great amount of practice for a rider to master this skill but having a quick shifter in hand can make this job a lot more easier. Basically when the rider shift gears either the ignition or the injection is switched off precisely so the gear is shifted in a linear fashion.

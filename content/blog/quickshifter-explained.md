description = "Quick shifters are handy when it comes to riding a bike on a track since it makes up-shifts lightening quick. But this is not the only reason you will need a quick shifter, the reason is it's absolutely great to put them in action. Keeping the throttle completely twisted and shifting through the gears without dipping the throttle back is one of the most insane feeling ever."

Clutch-less gear shifting is done by many riders manually by dipping the throttle precisely during the up-shifts. It requires a great amount of practice for a rider to master this skill but having a quick shifter in hand can make this job a lot easier. Basically when the rider shift gears either the ignition or the injection is switched off precisely so the gear is shifted in a linear fashion. Instead of pressing the clutch, engaging the gear and then releasing the clutch, you can seamlessly shift through the higher gears with the aid of a quick shifter.

### Functioning

Quick shifter with the help of sensors determines the movement of the gear lever to the next gear. When the rider moves the lever to the next gear, the movement is recognized and either the fuel or the ignition is cut off momentarily to remove the load of the engine on the transmission. Since there is no engine power provided to the transmission at this instance of time the gear can be changed without creating any physical damage to the transmission. Since the changing gears make less drama with a quick shifter the rider can concentrate more on the road.

### Calibration Factors

Even though it looks a kind of a effortless mechanism, Quick shifter needs to be calibrated well before getting it to use. Calibration of a quick shifter can be done with the software provided by the manufacturer. Some of the key factors for an impeccable functioning are as follows

#### 1. Type of shift pressure sensor

Generally, bikes with normal shift pattern use a pull type shift sensor for sensing the up-shift whereas bikes with race shift pattern use a push type shift sensor. In race shift pattern the gear lever has to be pressed down for higher gears. Basically, the primary function of shift sensor remains the same which is to trigger the quick shifting function. It's not necessary that every bike with normal shift pattern uses a pull type shift sensor, it is totally dependent on the geometry of the gear lever during an up-shift.

#### 2. Sensitivity

Sensitivity is the necessary amount of force to be exerted on the gear lever to trigger the quick shifting function. Increasing the sensitivity value means less force is enough to trigger the quick shifter action. If the sensitivity value is less a stronger force is needed to trigger the quick shift action which makes the gear shifts in a refined manner. Since the triggering point is closer to the shifting point when its less sensitive, it results in smooth transitions.

#### 3. Kill time vs RPM

Once the quick shifting action has been triggered, the engine management system relieves the stress in the transmission by enabling either a ignition or injection cut off for a particular period of time which is known as the Cut time or Kill Time ( In ms). Having a very short kill time may result in the damage of transmission and having a long kill time may lead to abrupt movement of vehicle during shifts. The kill time of the quick shifter should decrease with the increase in Engine RPM. Its better to avoid the quick shifting action at low engine RPM and low engine load conditions.

#### 4. Quick shifting sleep time

After the gear change it is vital to provide the quick shifter a sleep time for about 300 - 500 ms which will prevent false triggering of quick shifting action. And the quick shifting function must also be disabled at the highest gear. An ECM can determine the gear which is presently engaged using the engine speed and the vehicle speed.

#### Conclusion

Thus its important to calibrate quick shifter to its finest setting in accordance with driving conditions.

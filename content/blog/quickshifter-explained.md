description = "Quick shifters are handy when it comes to riding a bike on a track since it makes up-shifts lightening quick. But this is not the only reason you will need a quick shifter, the reason is it's absolutely great to put them in action. Keeping the throttle completely twisted and shifting through the gears without dipping the throttle back is one of the most insane feeling ever."

Clutch-less gear shifting is done by many riders manually by dipping the throttle precisely during the up-shifts. It requires a great amount of practice for a rider to master this skill but having a quick shifter in hand can make this job a lot easier. Basically when the rider shift gears either the ignition or the injection is switched off precisely so the gear is shifted in a linear fashion. Instead of pressing the clutch, engaging the gear and then releasing the clutch, you can seamlessly shift through the higher gears with the aid of a quick shifter.

### Functioning

Quick shifter with the help of sensors determines the movement of the gear lever to the next gear. When the rider moves the lever to the next gear, the movement is recognized and either the fuel or the ignition is cut off momentarily to remove the load of the engine on the transmission. Since there is no engine power provided to the transmission at this instance of time the gear can be changed without creating any physical damage to the transmission. Since the changing gears make less drama with a quick shifter the rider can concentrate more on the road.

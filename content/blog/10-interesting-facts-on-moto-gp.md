## INTRODUCTION
In MotoGP racing championship both performance and innovation goes hand in hand. And the bikes are purpose built for individual riders to enhance their control over the motorcycle in the track. Many technological improvements are made every year taking the competition between the bike manufacturers to a whole new level. Innovations which are made in MotoGP takes a considerable amount of time and money to reach the road going super bikes. So here are some interesting facts and technologies of MotoGP


## 1. HANDCRAFTED ENGINES FOR RACING AND RELIABILITY
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1524330584303_GSXR1216_08-1024x683.jpg)


The maximum displacement of the handcrafted engine to be used is 1000 cc and necessarily with  four cylinder blocks. Different manufacturers prefers different layout of engines such as Inline four, V- shaped or L-shaped engines. These engines are manufactured to rev all the way up to 18000 RPM and in an average the engines always runs closer to its rev limit. Since the same engine needs to be reused for different races its important to balance both reliability and performance. Each parameters of engine is engineered in a way to have a perfect relation with its rider. Since engines are not mass produced it increases the cost of MotoGP bikes significantly.


## 2. MAXIMIZING LEAN ANGLES BEYOND SCIENCE

Its not all about riding the motorcycle over 300 Kmph in a straight, its also equally important to maintain speeds in the corners. With all the exceptional technologies, cornering forces and the tires which are best for business, A MotoGP bike pulls out an staggering lean angle of 64 degrees. The lean angle is measured using a gyroscopic sensor and much more sensors assists the riders to get very close to their target lean angle. By adding up these technologies, external forces and the exceptional motoring skills of the rider its possible to get the 64 degrees mark. But still couldn’t figure out how Marc Marquez managed a 68 degrees lean ???


## 3. LOSE 4 KILOS IN LESS THAN AN HOUR

In an average a rider looses 2 liters of sweat in a 45 minutes race which is equivalent to three hours of intense workout or running a marathon in a humid and sunny day. Hence to overcome this loss of water from body riders are provided with hydration systems in their helmets. This is also the case in Formula 1 since the cockpit is too hot in racing conditions. Not only motoring skills but also fitness plays a indispensable role in MotoGP. It takes a lot of strength and caliber to tame those asphalts as per your wish.


## 4. REVERSE SHIFT PATTERN

Most of us would have come across the term GP Shifting. What is so special in it and how its done? MotoGP shifting can be known as reverse shifting pattern in which the first gear is above the neutral position and all other gears are below it which is exactly opposite to the standard pattern which is developed in the road going bikes. This reverse in shift pattern allows the rider to up-shift gears with ease and provides the rider with a small additional amount of ground clearance during cornering.


## 5. SEAMLESS TRANSMISSION

Seamless transmission can be related to the Dual clutch transmission in which the next gear is already engaged before the present gear is disengaged. In both MotoGP and Formula 1 racing seamless transmission is used since dual clutch gearboxes are not allowed for the World Championship. The seamless gearbox is engineered and handcrafted to match the rider’s characteristics which also adds up the cost of MotoGP bikes. A seamless gearbox aided with a quick shifting unit reduces the time gap for gear changes to 0.0064 seconds. This serves to be very critical since a rider changes gears for at least 500 to 800 times during a race.


## 6. PNEUMATIC VALVE TRAIN
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1524401052822_bg_slice06.jpg)


Since MotoGP engines revs up to 18000 RPM there is a possibility of valve springs attaining their resonance frequency which may lead to failure of valve train so spring force was replaced with the pneumatic force. These systems has a pressure accumulator which holds around 1000 bar and the time when it reaches the cylinder head its only around 10 bar due to various pressure leaks.Since the system does not include a pump within the bike its necessary to refill them before every race. The pressure which is developed can be sufficient for just one hour. Hope you would have guessed why pneumatic valve trains are not used in road going bikes.


## 7. KANGAROO LEATHERS ARE INDESTRUCTIBLE
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1524402766129_20162F022FAlpinestars-Race-Replica-Suit-Review_44231.jpg)


The riding gears are made up of Kangaroo’s leather with the thickness of almost 1 mm serves like a second skin to the rider. This 1 mm of thickness is enough to provide the rider with a good durability after a crash or a long slide. At overall the entire suit will weigh almost to 4.5kg. The hydration sits in the aerodynamic hump of the suit. Normally there will only be 200-300 milliliters of fluid because one of the big issues in racing is weight, and everybody wants to be as light as possible.


## 8. G FORCES GOES OVER THE TOP
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1524404305700_marc-marquez-motogp-austin.jpg)


In an average rider travelling over 320 kmph brakes to almost 150 kmph at the end of the straight in just a matter of seconds. With a little math we can calculate that a rider will experience around 1.93 g’s during deceleration which is almost equal to have a 150 kg block at the back of the rider. This is a lots of stress over the rider who is entering into a corner.


## 9. WEAR AND TEAR
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1524418701371_maxresdefault+1.jpg)


A MotoGP bike which pumps out almost 250 horses has an tire contact patch to the road with the size that is smaller than a credit card. Since there is only a small room for error, Tires are made with the objective of providing control and safety to the rider. Since the tires are put into extreme stress with higher load and temperatures MotoGP tires has a very short life span when compared with road going tires. Even Asymmetrical tires are used to provide different tire compound for each shoulder of the tire which may be dependent on the track conditions.


## 10. ENGINE NOISE LOUDER THAN A ROCK CONCERT
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D8829E279F04E125F2EAAC8B14A1C6C28B6107A6BDAAFA1C0CD2D6AE19EE454D_1524420103167_akrapovic-2946099_960_720.jpg)


Engines revving up to 18000 RPM can produce a sound louder than 125 dB. The safe time limit of hearing this loud orchestra is 8 minutes but hearing this for almost an hour may lead to damage in hearing. So MotoGP riders are made safer by using good soundproof helmets which makes the rider concentrate on the track

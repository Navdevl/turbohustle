description = "A perfect ignition and injection characteristics with regards to engine RPM and load alone is not sufficient in making a precise tune to the engine. In making the engine run efficiently in all operating conditions, its necessary to bring on some auxiliary maps on ignition and injection concerning different parameters. Having a proper tune on the primary tables such as fuel and ignition is necessary before entering to auxiliary maps."

### 1. Injection compensation for air temperature

The density of air decreases as there is a increase in temperature. So the fuel delivered must be less at higher intake temperatures and vice versa. Since at higher temperatures the air tends to move faster the compensation of injection must be less than half of the density correction. Compensation must be done for different load ranges namely Idle or Low load, Partial Load and High Load conditions. Its recommended to use a slightly less or no reduction of fuel at higher load conditions since having a rich mixture can reduce the peak temperature in combustion chamber.

### 2. Ignition correction for air temperature

Since higher temperature of air is likely to have more chance of producing knock its fine to sacrifice some torque by retarding the ignition timing at high intake air temperature. And it is not really necessary to advance the ignition timing at lower intake air temperatures.

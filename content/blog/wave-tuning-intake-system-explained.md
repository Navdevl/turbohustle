title = "Wave Tuning Intake System - Explained"
type = "post"

+++
A perfectly harmonized intake system is capable of improving the volumetric efficiency at certain rev range which thereby directly increases the torque output of the engine. The concept of wave tuning is that charge air travels in the waveform. The positive-pressure wave reaching the combustion chamber at the ideal time will have a supercharging effect in a Naturally aspirated engine.

### What is a Pressure Wave ?

When charge air gets inducted into the combustion chamber it travels in the form of the pressure wave. It travels at the speed of sound which is 1300 fps (foot per second) at 30 degree Celsius. The Speed of sound rises with the increase in the temperature.

#### Reflection of Sound Waves

Consider a low-pressure region traveling along the tube towards the plenum. The pressure of the air in the plenum is relatively higher than that of the low-pressure region, so when the low-pressure region hits the end of the tube, air from the plenum rushes in and creates a compression wave heading back down the tube. The opposite happens when a high-pressure region hits the end of the tube.

Now Consider a high-pressure region traveling along the tube towards a closed end, Since the closed end has infinite acoustic impedance, the pressure wave builds up and reflects again as an positive pressure wave.

### Events Causing Pressure Waves

#### 1. Valve Overlap

The duration when both the intake valve and the exhaust valve remains open is known as the overlap period. During the exhaust stroke, the exhaust gas is scavenged well which creates a low-pressure wave at the cylinder. This low-pressure wave gets away from the cylinder reflects back to the cylinder as a high-pressure wave.

#### 2. Intake Stroke

When the piston moves down the combustion chamber, it creates a low-pressure region which moves away from the cylinders. This low-pressure wave passes through the intake runner towards the plenum and gets reflected as a high-pressure wave and moves towards the cylinder.

#### 3. Closing of Intake Valve

When the intake valve closes the pressure rises and this high-pressure wave gets reflected towards the plenum and reflects as a low-pressure wave and hits the closed valve. Since the valve is closed the low-pressure wave gets reflected and reaches the plenum and is converted as the high-pressure wave and travels towards the cylinder.![](/img/2018/11/FAST-LS3-Runners-1200.jpg)

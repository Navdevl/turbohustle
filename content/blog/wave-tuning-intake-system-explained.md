title = "Wave Tuning Intake System - Explained"
type = "post"

+++
A perfectly harmonized intake system is capable of improving the volumetric efficiency at certain rev range which thereby directly increases the torque output of the engine. The concept of wave tuning is that charge air travels in the waveform. The positive-pressure wave reaching the combustion chamber at the ideal time will have a supercharging effect in a Naturally aspirated engine.

### What is a Pressure Wave ?

When charge air gets inducted into the combustion chamber it travels in the form of the pressure wave. It travels at the speed of sound which is 1300 fps (foot per second) at 30 degree Celsius. The Speed of sound rises with the increase in the temperature.

#### Reflection of Sound Waves

Consider a low-pressure region traveling along the tube towards the plenum. The pressure of the air in the plenum is relatively higher than that of the low-pressure region, so when the low-pressure region hits the end of the tube, air from the plenum rushes in and creates a compression wave heading back down the tube. The opposite happens when a high-pressure region hits the end of the tube.

Now Consider a high-pressure region traveling along the tube towards a closed end, Since the closed end has infinite acoustic impedance, the pressure wave builds up and reflects again as an positive pressure wave.

### Events Causing Pressure Waves

#### 1. Valve Overlap

The duration when both the intake valve and the exhaust valve remains open is known as the overlap period. During the exhaust stroke, the exhaust gas is scavenged well which creates a low-pressure wave at the cylinder. This low-pressure wave gets away from the cylinder reflects back to the cylinder as a high-pressure wave.

#### 2. Intake Stroke

When the piston moves down the combustion chamber, it creates a low-pressure region which moves away from the cylinders. This low-pressure wave passes through the intake runner towards the plenum and gets reflected as a high-pressure wave and moves towards the cylinder.

#### 3. Closing of Intake Valve

When the intake valve closes the pressure rises and this high-pressure wave gets reflected towards the plenum and reflects as a low-pressure wave and hits the closed valve. Since the valve is closed the low-pressure wave gets reflected and reaches the plenum and is converted as the high-pressure wave and travels towards the cylinder.

### Design Specifications

#### 1. Intake Runner Length

At lower revs, the engine cycle time is comparatively longer which means the pressure wave which gets reflected from the valve has a longer time duration to reach the cylinders. So its recommended to use a long intake runner, if you would go for lower end torque.

At higher revs, the cycle time gets so constrained that its closely impossible for the pressure wave to enter the cylinders with the same intake runners which was tuned for the torque at lower end. So you would need a shorter intake runner to get the most out of your machine at higher revs.

#### 2. Intake Runner Area

Unlike intake runner length which effects power over a small window of rpm range, the area of the intake runner will affect power over the entire rev range. A smaller port would increase the velocity at lower revs which help in efficient cylinder filling. But can also cause a restriction in the top-end flow. A larger port has less restrictions at the higher revs but a reduced flow velocity can result in poor volumetric efficiency at lower revs. 

### Calculating Runner Length

Since wave tuning provides better performance at certain rev range, its important to choose the desired rpm range. Lets tune the intake system to provide the best possible output at 5000 rpm.

We will be considering the Volkswagen Polo 1.2 litre Inline 4 cylinder. In this example of finding the ideal intake system which is tuned at 5000 rpm.

Bore = 71 mm. Stroke = 75.6 mm.

##### Step 1

**Intake Port Velocity = (Cylinder Bore Area / Intake Port Area) * MPS**

Here,

**Cylinder Bore Area = (3.14/4) * Bore^2**

_Cylinder Bore Area = 39.57 sq.cm_

**Mean Piston Speed = 2* Stroke * RPM**

_Mean Piston Speed = 75600 cm per minute_

For a 12.5 mm port diameter we have

**Intake Port Area = (3.14/4)* Bore^2**

Intake port Area = 1.226 sq.cm

**_Intake Port Velocity = 2440042 cm per minute (approx 1300 feet per second)_**

##### Step 2 

Consider a Intake cam shaft which opens the valves at 40 deg BTDC and 80 deg ABDC. So the time the valve is closed

**_Valve closed duration_** = 720 - 180 - 4 - 80 = **420 CKA**

At 5000 rpm Engine Cycle time is 24 ms.

So for 420 CKA we have 14 ms.

So the pressure wave can travel 18.2 feet in 14 ms.

Since the pressure wave has to return back to the cylinder , divide it by 2 which would become 9.1 feet runner. Nine feet is too long. You can't fit pipes that long under the hood of a car very easily. But there is a way to shorten the intake runners and still get some benefit from the pressure wave. If we shorten the intake runner length by a factor of four, making it 2.275 feet, the pressure wave will travel up and down the pipe four times before the intake valve opens again. But it still arrives at the valve at the right time.

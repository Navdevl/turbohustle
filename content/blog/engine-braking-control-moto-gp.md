description = "In early 1980's MotoGP riders employed the technique of engine braking to effectively decelerate the bikes due to lack of advancements in conventional friction brakes. But too much of engine braking can result in some adverse effects. Modern day electronics have made a great effort in neutralizing the undesirable effects of hard engine braking."

In an average, the rider traveling over 320 kmph brakes to almost 150 kmph at the end of the straight in just a matter of seconds. It means a tremendous braking force is needed to do it. Applying front brakes beyond its limit can make the bike flip over and too harsh on rear brakes can cause the bike to slide away. So MotoGP riders employed the technique of Engine Braking.

### Need for Advancements

Larger capacity motorcycles produce a greater force of engine braking which can be vulnerable in some situations. Too much of engine braking can make the rear wheel to lock-up with hazardous after-effects. When FIM reduced the maximum fuel consumption significantly, a severe engine braking technique was adopted by cutting off the fuel injectors when the rider lets off the throttle. But this strategy leads to severe crashes due to rear wheels getting locked-up frequently. After this, some refinement was made to the craft of engine braking through the modern electronics which is known as Engine Braking Control (EBC).
